# LSCA (Leukemic Stem Cell Activity) Score
LSCA score was designed for predicting AML patients' prognosis using cellular abundances. If you have a set of transcriptomic data of AML patients, you can predict the patients' prognosis by calculating LSCA score. Cellular abundances can be calculated by CIBERSORTx using a signature matrix called HemLin9 which is composed of more than 300 genes highly expressed in 9 cell types. Although abundances of LSCs (Leukemic Stem Cells) are not consider to calculate LSCA score, we have shown that this score are associated with highly expressed genes in LSCs.
